# Python module Convention &gt; Package Naming

## snake\_case

* Should be in lowercase.
* If the name contains multiple words, an underscore \(\_\) should separate it.E.g. expression\_engine
* The name should resonate with the class or methods inside the module

```python
from math import factorial
class Car:
    ...
```
