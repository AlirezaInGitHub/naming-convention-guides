# VueJS Naming Convention > Constants Naming

## SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- Should be all uppercase letters e.g. MAX_NUMBER_PEOPLE, PRICE
- If the name contains multiple words, it should be separated by an underscore(_) such as DAYS_IN_WEEK
- It may contain digits but not as the first letter

```js
const MAX_NUMBER_PEOPLE = 42
```
